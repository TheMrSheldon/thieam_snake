# THIeam Snake
THIeam snake is our entry for the [battlesnake.com](https://www.battlesnake.com) competition.
Our aim however is to build it flexible and expandable such that adding further functionality or forking this repository to implement your own battlesnake should be as intuitive and simple as can be.

## Setup & Build
To build this project the following software is required or recommended:
 1. CMake
 1. Working C++ compiler
 1. VSCode and respective VSCode extensions for C++ development with CMake (recommended)
 
After cloning the repository open the project in VSCode, press Ctrl+Shift+P and enter `CMake: Configure`. Choose your preferred C++ compiler when prompted.
Press Ctrl+Shift+P again and enter `CMake: Debug` to build and run the snake in debug-mode.
The first compile should take a bit longer since CMake has to download and build the dependencies.

## Forking to create your own snake
Are you interested in using our base-framework to build your own battlesnake on?
You are welcome to create a fork of this repository and modify the code as you need. We only ask for proper attribution.
